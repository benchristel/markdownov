# Product Guidelines

## Core Principles
- **User Configurability:** The balance between grammatical verisimilitude and output entropy must be configurable by the user, allowing them to tailor the generated text to their specific needs.
- **Linguistic Convincibility:** When configured for high verisimilitude, the output should be linguistically plausible enough to challenge basic automated filters.

## Visual and Structural Identity
- **Functional Utility:** The project's API and structural design should prioritize robustness and clarity, presenting itself as a reliable technical tool.
- **Professionalism:** The overall project identity should remain professional and utility-focused, avoiding unnecessary stylistic flourish in its core architecture.

## Tone and Voice
- **Technical and Direct:** Documentation, error messages, and API descriptions must be concise, accurate, and focused on implementation and usage.
- **Clear and Specifications-Driven:** Favor precise technical language and detailed examples over conversational prose.
